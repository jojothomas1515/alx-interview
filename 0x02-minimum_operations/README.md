<h1>Minimum Operations to Generate 'n' H Characters</h1>

<p>This method calculates the fewest number of operations needed to obtain exactly 'n' occurrences of the character 'H' in a text file. The text editor supports two operations: Copy All and Paste.</p>

<h2>Prototype</h2>
<pre><code>def minOperations(n)</code></pre>

<h2>Returns</h2>
<ul>
    <li>An integer representing the minimum number of operations required to achieve 'n' 'H' characters.</li>
    <li>Returns 0 if it's impossible to achieve 'n' 'H' characters.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre><code>n = 9
# Steps:
# H
# Copy All
# Paste
# HH
# Paste
# HHH
# Copy All
# Paste
# HHHHHH
# Paste
# HHHHHHHHH
# Total operations: 6
min_operations = minOperations(n)  # Returns 6</code></pre>

<h2>Method Explanation</h2>
<p>The problem can be approached by repeatedly applying the two operations, Copy All and Paste. The goal is to generate 'n' occurrences of the character 'H' with the fewest number of operations.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Start with one occurrence of 'H'.</li>
    <li>Repeatedly copy all existing characters and paste them until the desired count is reached.</li>
    <li>Keep track of the total number of operations performed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The method iterates over possible divisors of 'n' (excluding 1), and for each divisor 'd', it calculates the corresponding quotient 'q' (i.e., n // d). The number of operations needed to reach 'n' using 'd' occurrences of 'H' is 'd + q'. We need to find the divisor 'd' that minimizes the total operations.</p>
<p>The method then returns the minimum operations calculated.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if 'n' is prime or not divisible by any number other than 1, it's impossible to achieve 'n' 'H' characters, and the method will return 0.</p>
